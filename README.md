## Homework Statement:
   You are expected to implement a Stack and a PriorityQueue Class which store the data in
linked lists. Each member function that you should implement is explained by comments. You are
supposed to use the Node class in the lectures. Note that these classes are to be implemented in
different .h files. For each class, a template file is shared with you. You should add them to your
project and write all methods in those files.
